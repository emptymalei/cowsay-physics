If we define

1. Newton's gravitational constant $G=1$,
2. Speed of light $c=1$,

kg and meter is related through

$$
\frac{G}{c^2} = 1,
$$

which is equivalent to

$$
7.425\times 10^{-28} \mathrm{m}\mathrm{kg^{-1}} = 1.
$$

Using this relation we find that

$$
1 \mathrm{kg} = 7.425\times 10^{-28} \mathrm{m}.
$$


In SI units, we know that solar mass is $1.988\times 10^{30}\mathrm{kg}$ and the mass of Earth is $5.972\times 10^{24}\mathrm{kg}$. The consersion to meters is straight forward.

By the way, the value of mass in length (meters) is called geometrized value.
