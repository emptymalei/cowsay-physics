## How to submit

1. Submit your cowsay at <a href="{{ site.github_repo }}/issues">GitHub Issues</a>.
2. You can either submit the text only. I will create the corresponding cowsay by myself based on it. 
3. Please provide names or links so I can give you the credit.

## How to create

To create a cowsay, use cowsay in terminal. Alternatively, [Cowsay Online](http://cowsay.morecode.org/) provides online version of cowsay.
